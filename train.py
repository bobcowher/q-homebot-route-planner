# REAL-REWARD REACH FIX (champion 314 architecture). The whack-a-mole "reach"
# failure traced to a reward bug: the goal env rewarded + terminated every goal at a
# flat GOAL_THRESHOLD=79px (compute_reward), but the task actually collects trash only
# at 31px (tasks.py). We trained the policy to park at 79 and graded it at 31.
# FIX (no per-target hand-engineering):
#   - env.step now uses the TaskManager's TRUE per-target reward and terminates on
#     real task completion (is_done), not a geometric radius.
#   - compute_reward is demoted to the HER hindsight relabel proxy ONLY, at a single
#     tight RELABEL_RADIUS=31 (the tightest real radius; satisfies door/fixtures too).
# Goal = the trash pile itself (random_goal_tiles OFF). n_trash=1 so the single trash
# == the conditioned goal == the completion event (at n_trash=2 the real reward fires
# for EITHER pile, decoupling reward from the goal coord). spawn_trash is uniform over
# valid floor tiles, so a single random trash keeps full-map coverage -- we get an
# arbitrary-coord reacher AND a real reward, not a fixed-spot specialist.
# Clean A/B vs 314 (4.30/38% chain, 5.8% deploy spin) on the collect_trash leg:
# chained_eval.py + spin_metric. her_anneal_start=None keeps HER's dense relabel
# grounding the whole run (the tight 31px target needs it).
